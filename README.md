Config files for zsh, vim, and others.

All zsh related files will be stored in $HOME/.zsh
All vim related files will be stored in $HOME/.vim
The .zshrc and .vimrc files will be in the $HOME directory

This is not meant to be an extensive set-up or an automated config.
It is simply an easy way to port commonly used settings across multiple machines.
